# Design Pattern
<hr>

## Strategy Pattern
*The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.*

### Intent
- Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- Client-specified embellishment of a core object by recursively wrapping it.

    NOTE: 
        
    - Context can be either a CONCRETE class or ABSTRACT class.
    
    - Client can either be a new Class or instance of Context
<hr>

## Observer Pattern
*The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically.*

## Intent
- Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- Encapsulate the core (or common or engine) components in a Subject abstraction, and the variable (or optional or user interface) components in an Observer hierarchy.
- The "View" part of Model-View-Controller.

    Design Principle:

    - Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
    - Program to an interface, not an implementation.
    - Favor composition over inheritance.

    NOTE:
    
    - Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

## Decorator Pattern

*The Decorator Pattern attaches additional
responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality.*

## Intent
- Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- Client-specified embellishment of a core object by recursively wrapping it.

![decoratorPattern](../images/decoratorpattern.png)

    Design Principle:
    - Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

    NOTE:

    - Be careful when choosing the areas of code that need to be extended; applying the Open-Closed Principle EVERYWHERE is 
    wasteful and unnecessary, and can lead to complex, hard-to-understand code.
<hr>

## Factory Pattern
*The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface
for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.*

### Intent
- Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- Defining a "virtual" constructor.
- The new operator considered harmful.

![FactoryPattern](../images/factorypattern.png)

    Design Principle:

    - Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

    NOTE: 

    - instantiation is an activity that shouldnâ€™t always be done in public and can often lead to coupling problems
